# china_houses

In this project, we are dealing with the real data of Beijing city houses and we are doing comprehensive and useful analyzes on this data set and we are displaying the results of the analyzes by drawing graphs.

This project consists of 5 main parts:

* In the first part, the data will be read and the columns that are not needed will be deleted. Also, some thought is given to missing values.
* In the second part, the columns are converted to the appropriate format and extraneous data are removed.
* In the third part, using the existing features, new features are created, which will be very useful in the next two steps.
* In the fourth part, using the longitude and latitude of the houses, we show them on the map to get a general view of that area.
* In the last step, using the time of transactions, we analyze the time of transactions.

Finally, I would like to thank [Quera](https://quera.org/) for allowing me to publish this project.
